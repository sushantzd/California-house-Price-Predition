# California-house-Price-Predition
California House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using a dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset contains various features such as median income, house age, total rooms, and more, which are used to train a multiple linear regression model.

Key Features of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Prepared and explored the California housing dataset using pandas and numpy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an analysis to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
Multiple Linear Regression: Built and trained a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on the features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Libraries Used:
* pandas

* numpy
  
* scikit-learn
  
* matplotlib
